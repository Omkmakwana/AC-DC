        <h2>About the Band</h2>
        <p>AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973. Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, although the band calls it simply "rock and roll". They are cited as a formative influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands.</p>
        
        <p>The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 and has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time.</p>
        
        <h3>Formation and Early Years</h3>
        <p>AC/DC were founded by brothers Angus (lead guitar) and Malcolm Young (rhythm guitar), along with Colin Burgess (drums), Larry Van Kriedt (bass guitar), and Dave Evans (lead vocals). They underwent several line -up changes before releasing their debut Australasian-only album, <i>High Voltage</i> (1975).</p>
        
        <h3>Rise to Fame</h3>
        <p>Membership stabilized after the release of <i>Let There Be Rock</i> (1977), with the Young brothers, Phil Rudd on drums, Cliff Williams on bass guitar, and Bon Scott on lead vocals. Seven months after the release of <i>Highway to Hell</i> (1979), Scott died of alcohol poisoning, and English singer Brian Johnson was then recruited as their new frontman.</p>
        
        <h3>Major Albums</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Back in Black</i> (1980) - Dedicated to Scott's memory, became the second best-selling album of all time.</li>
            <li><i>For Those About to Rock</i> (1981) - Their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200.</li>
            <li><i>The Razors Edge</i> (1990) - Marked a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li><i>Black Ice</i> (2008) - The second highest-selling record of 2008.</li>
            <li><i>Power Up</i> (2020) - Released after a reunion of the Rock or Bust line-up.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
        <p>The band's line-up remained the same for 20 years until 2014, when Malcolm retired due to early-onset dementia, from which he died three years later. Angus and Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young, replaced Malcolm and debuted on the album <i>Rock or Bust</i> (2014).</p>
        
        <p>In 2016, Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose replaced Johnson for the rest of the tour dates due to a risk of hearing loss. Williams retired at the end of the tour, and the band entered a two-year hiatus. A reunion of the Rock or Bust line-up was announced in September 2020, and the band's seventeenth studio album, <i>Power Up</i>, was released two months later.</p>
        
        <p>Its supporting tour was announced in February 2024, with drummer Matt Laug replacing Rudd, and bassist Chris Chaney replacing Williams.</p>
